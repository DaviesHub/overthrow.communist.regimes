# overthrow.communist.regimes
Simple Java written game where players take down communist regimes in a grid.

In this game, 'communist regimes' are randomly placed in a virtual 7x7 grid
and the player is supposed to guess the coordinates of the communist regimes. A communist regime is overthrown
when the coordinates of the cells it occupies are successfully guessed. The goal is to overthrow the communist
regimes with the fewest number of guesses possible.
